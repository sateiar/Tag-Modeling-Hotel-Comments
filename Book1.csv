"We recently stayed at the hotel for the second time in two years. We really enjoyed it last time, but this time was even better. From the moment you walk into the hotel you know you are in for a treat. Helpful staff (we must mention Shafiq Ghani, whose is so welcoming, warm and professional), a wonderful memberâ€™s lounge and spectacular rooms. We were in a junior suite, which was larger than most one bedroom apartments! It is also located in probably the best part of the city, amongst wonderful shopping, fabulous restaurants and bars. One of my favourite hotels in Asia."
"We arrived in KL from Singapore and we could not have picked a better location for our hotel. Everything was great about the JW Marriott. Check in was very easy and we had a lovely room overlooking the pool. Breakfast was in the restaurant and there was a wonderful array of food to be had. Special mention to the egg station workers who were always on the go making all different types of orders. Location wise the hotel is perfect, right opposite the Pavilion shopping centre. If you needed to use the metro then that was less then a 5 minute walk away. All in all a fabulous stay"
"After a long week of being in 3 locations in Asia (Bangkok, KL, and Malacca) spending the weekend at the Exec Lounge was perfect. I met wonderful people and had cocktails with expats from all over. At only 250RM/day for the meals, snacks, drinks, soccer games, etc it was well worth it, while I had to stay close to my laptop. The host, Shafiq, was by my side and others with great service and positive attitude. On a Sat night in the lounge my energy was brought to another level before going out for the night (walking distance to Changkat / Nagasari bars; awesome night life). I was here alone from the U.S. on business and appreciated the welcoming attitude of Shafiq and Exec Lounge Team at JW."
"We arrived at the JW tired from our prior 4 weeks of traveling in Asia without having done our homework to explore the Kuala Lumpur. Within moments of entering the executive lounge Shafiq was at our table introducing himself and making sure that we were enjoying tea time. He asked what we had planned and when we told him nothing at that time, Shafiq immediately went to work. After our meal, he invited us to his desk where he made several suggestions and more importantly listened to our desired highlights. Shafiq arranged for a driver to pick us up the next morning and show us all of the KL highlights that we asked for. One of the items was the Petronas towers. As it happened, the tickets were sold out. He made several calls and was able to secure us tickets. We also visited the Kingâ€™s palace, the center of government, and multiple other sites. We had a wonderful day! Shafiq arranged that we would have the same driver the following night. Prior to our departure he provided Us with a care package of club sandwiches and French frys just in case we needed a snack. The evening included a tour of a Hindu temple, silver leaf monkeys, a seafood dinner at the river and a river cruise highlighting fireflies. The fireflies lit up the trees like Christmas time. Additionally Shafiq checked in on us multiple times each day and night. His attention to detail was amazing! I highly recommend both the KL JW Marriott and equally important the hospitality of Shafiq! We canâ€™t wait until our next visit!"
"Jw Marriott is definitely is a good choice! Super convenient to get to anywhere. Especially it is facing to Pavilion Mall, Front desk agent was absolutely amazing! Professional ladies & gentlemen! Highly recommended. "
A very big thank you to Mr Vellu at JW Marriott hotel executive lounge for his team's trully 5 star service .We will be permanently bringing all our business guest to stay at JW Marriott hotel kl Malaysia.Thanks Dr Al Wee
"As a frequent traveler (+180 nights per year international travel), I see and experience all levels of hotel quality and service. But at the JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur, there is only one level.....EXTRAORDINARY. I use every aspect of the property (Executive Lounge, SPA, Pool, Gym, Laundry, Business Center, etc.) and all are first class. And while the physical property is good, the people are spectacular. They make my stay in KUL special EVERY TIME. they never disappoint. None are better than the Exec Lounge staff. A great example is Shafiq Ghani. He goes out of his way every evening to accommodate my needs....book a car, book a restaurant, set up laundry, secure meeting space....he does it all. I can highly recco this property for anyone; but if you are a business traveler, JW Marriott KUL is the only place to stay."
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Everything was great. Our room was comfortable, the pool was nice, and the food downstairs was delicious. Also, the staff were wonderful, particularly our cleaner Mozibur on the 20th floor. He was very friendly and made sure our room was always perfect."
Got this hotel for a steal; love that it's adjacent to Starhill. Our room overlooked Tiffany & Co! Buffet breakfast was extensive (Western and Malaysian options) - love that there's a roti station! Would absolutely stay here again.
"Staff are friendly, helpful and provide great service during stay. Front staff did follow up how kid stay and how room condition. Housekeeping staff and restaurants staff very professional provided thier service"
Stayed at this property for 3 days. Executive room with city view at the top floor was superb. Very well clean and hygiene. Hotel is located at prime location. Enjoyed Food at Executive lounge(2nd floor) and at Shook (at LG) for variety in morning breakfast. Staffs are very cordial. Specially Mr. Zakir and Mr. Velu at Executive lounge are very quick in their service and are very helpful.
"Stayed at this property for 3 days, we were a big group so had booked 5 rooms here.The location of the hotel is very good , right in the heart of the shopping district. The hotel was undergoing some renovation so their main dining area was not open at that time . Overall the rooms were a bit small but nice and clean. The buffet breakfast was average.The reason for the low rating is the staff. I have not come across such a cold un responsive hotel staff anywhere in my travels it was as if someone was forcing them to work there. They were going through their daily duties in almost robot like fashion. No smile no warmth. Whatever you asked them they would do it but would take their own time and no explanation was given . All of us really felt unwelcome there.No matter how good the infrastructure is but the heart and soul of any hotel are its people and in this area the hotel failed miserably.I would not want to stay here again as I really expected something more from an international hotel chain like Marriott"
"Somehow I just felt that the staffs are not so hospitable. I was greeted by an icy cold lady handling our check in process. She was not mean or anything, but more like a an employee who hates her job, no smiles at all. Most of the other staffs were like that as well. Anyway, good location, but the hotel itself is just mediocre. The room is oddly designed - maybe for space efficiency, but itâ€™s not really a plus point in terms of layout. The other thing that really bothered me was the restaurant for breakfast. It was super packed, bad service, and the food tasted horrible. We ended up going to the M lounge, which is honestly not the best (compared to other Marriott hotels) but at least itâ€™s better than the restaurant downstairs."
"I've stayed in Multiple Marriott properties and this properties is has given me the least customer service... Marriott has now introduced chatting via their App, which is useful but this property should look at their back ground staff and also make sure that one of their best staff is at the front desk, who knows how a Marriott guest is treated."
"Stayed at the JW Marriot on a two day business trip. The hotel is located in the buzzling Bukit Bintang known for shopping malls and nightlife! The property is just opposite The Pavilion mall and is full of life. If you are a business traveller or on a vacation, this would be a nice spot to stay in. However, reaching other business districts in KL would be slightly farther than KLCC. But yes, it's worth compromising a bit of travel time for the leisure stay post a long working day. I stayed in a Deluxe Twin (smoking) on the 8th floor. The room was well appointed, clean linen, clean carpets and upholstery. Had all required amenities such as mini bar, coffee maker, a large 42"" (if I'm right) LCD. The bath had a tub, and a supply of toiletries. The room on the smoking floor however smells quite awfully of cigarette smoke even as I entered the room. Understand there would be trace of cigarette smell in a smoking room, but I felt it was intoxicating. Would be good if there could be something to remove the odour. Food is excellent and hotel staff are friendly. Check in and check out was hasslefree. However when I requested for a room with a King bed instead of a twin, the request was not acknowledged."
"This is my first stay here with my family and definitely more to come! Spacious room with splendid view, near to the city ! I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate the quality service that Justin ( Front desk )given us .We want to highlight your dedication to help us with the check in and highlighted the facilities, wireless etc with great enthusiasm.Last but not least , I would not hesitate to intro friends/Family to JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur.Once again, Thank you Justin! Looking forward to our next visit."
"Busy area, malls all around, very modern, beautiful hotel close to everything you would like to visit in KL. Amazingly done rooms, great breakfast, equally great bed, city sky line view- place to be in KL. bucket bunting clubs, shopping, restaurants all around."
"Had a great time and great view. Centred in the middle of the city in Bukit bintang and in front of pavilion. Great location and lovely staff. I would recommend this place to everybody. Especially the bellman, I forgot his name, but a great helper."
"Haven't stayed here in 2 years and what a difference from the past. Everything is new, from the lobby to the elevators and the rooms. Nice and modern touch with extension use of marble.No complains on the rooms but the entrance could use more attention. Unlike Westin, hardly anyone greets you when you walk in. And most of the time, no one would see you walk in.Checking in and out took a looonng time. Don't know the process they have but it certainly is difference from the US where the person takes 1 look at the terminal and basically tells you ""You're all set!"". All done in 30seconds or 1 min. Over here, it took around 5-10 mins."
Stayed for one night only but the experience was great. Great location and rooms. Superb facilities. Lovely breakfast. Excellent services. Cleanliness all around. Shopping arcade was just too good. Lots of opportunities to take beautiful pictures in and around hotel. A bit expensive though but understandable that we were travelling at the peak of tourist season.
"We were here for a very short time when our flight got delayed.The hotel was beautiful, and the bed was comfy. However, it doesnâ€™t really have a good noise canceling as we can here noise (more like a conversation and a kidâ€™s tantrum) from the room next to us.I really appreciate the breakfast. The variation and the taste was amazing. Moreover the fresh juice and the Malaysian food station. "
"Ill go point wise. Its easier to follow my train of thoughts. 1. Check in was a bit slow. The guests were just asking for too many requests. Also not all the kiosks were attended by JW receptionists. Hence tge slow check in. 2. Got the room we booked for. Once we went to the 18th floor, the room cards were not working. Tht was frustrating as the elevators were slow and i did not want to go to lobby again. Luckily housekeeping was there and he sensed my frustration. He was kind enough to be of assistance. 3. Room was adequate and spacious. Modern with top notch facilities. Bathroom was just awesome. Fridge, in room speace was good. Closet space was a tad bit small. But my wife and i loved it. 4. The star of the show was JWs spa. The steam and sauna were mind blowing. A proper relaxing area with tea coffee machines. The gym was just fantastic and we used it during our stay. It was part of starhill gallery and was just 5 star facilities. Pool was really good too. 5. Now, here is why my subject was mixed review. At breakfast at shook, it was extremely busy. By accident another lady sat on our table. When i asked one of the waiters ( i will not mention his name as the hotel management was duly informed) to find us a table, his response was, 'do you see sny tables empty?' I totally lost it. This is JW not a mid tier hotel and im paying a bloody premium to stay here. And i would expect proper premium service and if i may be allowed to say, proper etiquette. The restaurant manager was extremely sorry and i guess there is a rotten apple in a basket, but i expected jw not to faulter as its one of my highest rated and poshiest hotels. Anyways the rest of the staff were extremely sorry. 6. The hotel manager, Mr Yannick was a true gentleman. When requesting for a late checkout he catered to our need and that was extremely nice of him. So thank you. 7. Location of the hotel is fantastic. Staff of the hotel was professional and courteous. Just a major fault at the restaurant which i guess cost JW its rating. It is more than 5 stars. Just such glitches should be looked into. My wife loved your hotel. Just the breakfast area can be improved on and maybe proper screening of the servers. "
My visit was three years agoHotel is really a five star . Location is very good close to the nearest shopping area .like the swimming pool .food is rich .staff are helpful. Price is acceptable .good luck
"Our stay in JW Marriot was just for three days although our bedroom was really nice and the staff was amazing! The wi-fi works really well (but we had the premium package). The breakfast had lots of choice not just Asian food! The location is great, across the road you have a giant mall."
Jw marriott is definitely everyone choice! Super convenient to get by anywhere everywhere. But what matters most is their excellent tiptop service! Front desk agent ms carmen was absolutely amazing! Professional ladies & gentlemen! Highly recomended to all other tourist! My first choice hotel whenever im in KL! â¤
"Room is excellent, you have your own wifi access dedicated to the room. TV entertainment is good...non-stop watching movies i.e. if you don't feel like going out to shop. The hotel is located right in the heart of where the shops are...Pavilion is right in front of the hotel.Bathroom is great! Bed is comfortable. The sofa can also convert to a bed. Hotel breakfast buffet is splendid with so many choices!"
"That's exactly how I would describe JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur. I was here for 3 nights last week and I'm usually the sort who takes at least a day or two to get remotely comfortable in any accommodation other than my own place, BUT this hotel has some of the most comfortable beds and pillows EVER that I found myself sleeping very soundly the second my head hit the pillow. It's also located right at the heart of Bukit Bintang - walking distance from some of the biggest malls and restaurants and yes, the biggest Sephora outlet in Malaysia. Starhill is actually below Marriott, Sephora is next door, and the Pavilion is right across. There's Fahrenheit mall nearby as well. I didn't get to enjoy the breakfast coz I wold usually wake up very late, but I would assume it's good judging by the comments here.:) And oh, there is a connector/access that leads to The Ritz-Carlton from JW Marriott. I love this hotel!"
"We stayed for two nights at JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur on route to Koh Tao. This is a superbly managed hotel with excellent staff. The manager Yannick introduced himself to us and was extremely enthusiastic in making sure that we were happy; and we were.He recommended Vertigo Bar, the highest in KL and certainly worth a visit. The manager, Jonathan, made sure we were looked after. Really good experience.The cabana rooms by the pool are really excellent.Highly recommend!"
"It was nice going back to JW Marriott after awhile. Check-in is always easy and the staffs are friendly. Believe the rooms were renovated as looks new. It is still comfy and clean. The hotel is centrally located and therefore this hotel is popular among tourist and business alike. The breakfast spread is huge and you can have different type of food. Its always nice to be back to this hotel once a while. Great for family, leisure and business."
"YOu will enjoy an amazing stay here, the environment is perfect for an urban holiday. Just a few steps away you will be able to shop your high fashion amenities. Also, getting foods from outside the hotel is easy and the hygene is great."
"Excellent hotel and excellent location right amongst all the high end shopping and malls of Bukit Bintang. We booked an room with access to the Executive Lounge which seemed to offer pretty good value. Evening canapes and snacks were quite substantial, high quality and varied. The lounge was large although also quite busy (numbers seemed to increase with western businessmen inviting their local female 'friends' for the free spread). Breakfast in the lounge was also good, not the most extensive options but certainly very pleasing and with eggs/noodles to order.The rooms were as expected - plush, old school wood and marble and heavenly beds. The addition of a capsule coffee machine was very welcome.The pool area was nice and the gym was sufficient although the aircon could have been a bit better in there. The gentlemans spa area with sauna, steam and jacuzzi was a treat at the end of a hard day at the office.I'd definitely return."
"I would always stay with JW Marriott when holidaying in Kuala Lumpur.And now that they just refurbish the rooms..its just a treat. Room was huge and clean. I've booked their Deluxe room. The new bathroom is so chic with a bathtub.Their front desk,customer service officers, bell staffs were so helpful, efficient and always smilling.Their breakfast at the Shook restaurant has delicious food that will suit every taste buds. JUST YUMMY!!Location is just a hop away. Pavillion, Saphora,Lot 10 and Berjaya time sq is so close by.Highly recommend this hotel."
"Was greeted by Mr Tika and he came over and wanted to make sure all things are well. Other than checking on my needs, he was also very attentive to see if there are any areas which they can assist further. Really make my stay with the hotel enjoyable and fuss free. Mr Tika is very professional. Great to have staff like him at the hotel! Great service."
"Me and my wife stayed here for our honeymoon, from the time we checked in we were treated like royalty. Breakfast is perfect with a wide range of food so suit anybody! We stayed in room 1503 with pool views ( floor 15 pool is on floor 6) room is massive with a luxurious bathroom! The only thing I could fault was the pillows ... but my partner likes them so I guess thatâ€™s preference. I spent my birthday here which the hotel made special by bringing me cake and decorating the room. They where super helpful when inquiring where to eat or what to do ! And would go out there way for anyone. Location is perfect for eating and shopping. Loved it and will stay when we come back one day! "
"It was my first time to stay in Kuala Lumpur. I chose JW marriott randomly. It turned out a great experience in KL. The location is in the heart of KL closed to malls and famous restaurants. The room was clean, modern and bed was very comfortable and they did great job on the service."
"Sorry for my late post on review page.Maybe I can say this is for the Tenth Time I have stayed at this Incredible, Comfortable, Luxury, and the best JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur Hotel. I always tell to concierge and receptionist staff that this hotel is my second home! am i overreacting? maybe the readers can answer it...For this time I choose a brand new ""Cabana Poolside"" room which was previously suggested by Ms Abii (Quality Manager). She is friendly, smart, pretty and very kind person. This new room located on Level 6 is a few steps from the inviting pool and new pool bar, I can now simply stroll out of room to enjoy a refreshing cocktail. Not only that but also made me feel a more privacy and leisure-focused stay. Brilliant room!My room is near elevator, so makes me easier and faster to go down to lobby floor and also easier access to any facilities from the hotel such as Fitness Center, Starhill Spa Village and absolutely Executive Lounge.I want to say so many thanks to Ms Abii who always give the best assistance which I always need it. And this man Mr Asmawi always pleasure to help me take my luggage to the lobby before I check out and depart from the hotel.Thank you for All of you and I really appreciated!At the end of my word, JW Marriott Hotel Kuala Lumpur is the best Hotel EVER!See you on my next visit! and send my regards to Mr Skaf.(I also share some photos and some old photos that I forgot to share)Warmest Regards."
"(Full disclosure : Our stay at this hotel used Marriott Rewards points, so didnâ€™t cost us anything. We also received a room upgrade due to my current membership status.)We stayed at the J W Marriott Kuala Lumpur for 2 nights recently as part of a holiday trip, and thoroughly enjoyed the visit.The location on Jalan Bukit Bintang is a good starting point for finding your way round the city, with access to public transport a few minutes away, and the Petronas Towers/KLCC area accessible in about 15-20 minutes walk through a covered walkway. Itâ€™s also a good place to experience the buzz (well, mayhem) of the city at night, and handy for one of the best street food areas in Jalan Alor. Our room was a Junior Suite, with a view over Bukit Bintang. Even for a suite, we found the room big and comfortable, with all the facilities we could have wanted (including a couple of huge TVs!) and a good sized, well equipped bathroom. My only comment is that the WC was rather small for someone of average height, but thatâ€™s a really minor point.We also had access to the hotelâ€™s exec lounge, which we used for breakfast and evening drinks. The staff were incredibly helpful, and couldnâ€™t do enough for you. I did find the layout of the room a little off putting â€“ it was large enough to hold the number of guests using it, but room felt like a single large area, with sound levels to match when it was busy. We spent a lot of time there, but I think it could have done with some design changes to make it feel more intimate.The staff in the rest of the hotel had the same approach â€“ very helpful, very friendly and very professional. We used the concierge desk a lot in particular, and really appreciated the advice and directions they gave us.Highly recommended. Weâ€™d certainly come back if we visit again."
"We have been staying at this hotel for many years since we started visiting KL, but 2 years ago when we went, the hotel was undergoing renovation. I must say that the newly refurbished JW does not disappoint. The rooms look much bigger, and the bathrooms so much more better and comfortable!! Itâ€™s proximity to the Pavilion Mall and other shopping areas is very convenient. Moreover the place is always charged and buzzing with activity!! A special mention to the front office and hose keeping staff of the hotel, they are extremely courteous, prompt and helpful!!"
"My husband and I lived in KL for almost 4 years and recently returned to the US. For the last week that we were in KL, after moving out of our apartment, we chose to stay at the JW Marriott KL. Knowing the city well, we chose the JWM because of it's great location. We chose it over the Grand Hyatt, the Mandarin Oriental and even the sister property, the Ritz Carlton because it was the best of all things considered - location, price, quality, and because we are Marriott Rewards members.The JWM did not disappoint, in fact it really impressed us. Our checkin was at 1AM, but the hotel staff took care of us efficiently and professionally so that we could get to sleep as soon as possible. The recent renovation was a success - the rooms are fresh, open and well planned with more than usual places to store things without having to tuck them in drawers (and forget them!). The rooms are very quiet, even at night in the midst of the downtown hustle and bustle. The lobby is also fresh and open, able to accommodate huge groups of people without feeling crowded or noisy.Take a recommendation from a former KL expat - if you are choosing among the top hotels in the city, definitely choose the JWM and you won't be disappointed!"
"A luxurious 5 star hotel. Exceptional service. Beautiful rooms. Recently updated so its modern state of the art. A brilliant location, canâ€™t be faulted. I have stayed at many hotels in KL this is far and above the best . "
"Again, I traveled for business. This time I got to stay in JW Marriot. What I like was that they provided amenities like no others. I brought my own shaver and mouthwash but turned out they already provided them all. The room was also spacious and I was assigned a twin bed. They also served complements like macaroons in my room on the first night. And oh, it's located in the vibrant area of KL which is Bukit Bintang."
"Customer service at the JW Marriot was beyond expectations. I travel a lot and stayed in many 4-5 star hotels before and I rate the service at this hotel one of the best. The room was clean, modern and bed was very comfortable. Location is great. Just cross the road front of the hotel and you will be in one of the best malls (The Pavilion) in Malaysia. I had the breakfast provided by the hotel at one of their signature restaurants. The service was again top notched and food was very good. I will definitely stay at JW Marriot again when I am in Malaysia. Great value for your money!!"
"Such an awful unexpected experience just trying to check in to this hotel. Booked for two nights so that I could check in early morning next day and they still donâ€™t have my room ready and plan to charge me for two! Worst part was that the front desk guy tried to play it cool and didnâ€™t go through any effort to apologize or compensate however told me I can hang around, perhaps go have breakfast!!?Last time I had the same experience was at a roadside motel in the countryside. The Bell hops seemed to understand customer service a lot more than front desk. Congrats JW Kuala Lumpur, you made me write my first Hotel review! "
"I stayed for two nights at the executive level and I have nothing to fault against this hotel. Excellent location, service and food. The recently renovated rooms are comfortable and modern. I do not like too much pampering, so perhaps that is the only slight negative positive. The only negative was at check-in when I felt the girl serving me was pompous. Small issue as I was in a hurry. "
"Went on vacation and stayed at the KL JW Marriott and also KL Westin & Shinta Mani Shack in Siem Reap, Cambodia (see those other reviews).Iâ€™m giving this JW Marriott in KL an Excellent rating. Itâ€™s primarily due to the exceptional staff and guest service I received there. I am a frequent user of TripAdvisor but am not a frequent contributor and this time, it occurred to me how great (and consistent, Iâ€™ve stayed at KL JW Marriott two other times) my experience has been and thought I should share with fellow travelers.Iâ€™m a lifetime Marriott Platinum and have traveled quite a bit in NA, Europe and Asia. Iâ€™ve not stayed at the ultra high-end hotels but stayed in many of the mainstream high-end hotels like different Marriott, Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt hotels, Shangri-la, misc boutiques, and various other brands. The guest service I received at this specific JW Marriott is arguably the best (and definitely in the top 3) Iâ€™ve experienced.Letâ€™s start with some basics first.-- Clean and updated hotel. Nice white lights (vs the yellowish kind). You canâ€™t beat the location if you are a foodie and want to do shopping. Rail system is close by. Great variety of food can be found close by at Lot 10, Jalan Alor and Pavilion food court.-- The Pavilion is a major mall across the street, there are numerous smaller ones close by including the Starhill which has brands that Iâ€™ve not heard of before (and way out of my price range)-- Upgraded room was fine but I have experienced better-- Executive lounge food was okay but somewhat disappointing (more on that below)-- Pool was on the 6th floor. I spent some time with my laptop working around the pool, it was nice setting-- I used points for my stay but the price point for this hotel is good. The USD to Ringgit helps quite a bit, currently approx. 1-to-4. Iâ€™ve paid more in the US for much lesser hotels-- I never visited and canâ€™t comment on the restaurants in the hotel. Too busy with the wealth of other options close by The differentiator is the guest service provided by the great staff. Friendly smiles, politeness, attentiveness, willingness to engage in a conversation, and offer to help from everyone. It was all very genuine. Examples at this hotel (but also experienced) at other hotels as well were:-- Door men and bell hop smiling and taking my luggage, opening the doors etc. -- Warm greeting by name from front desk-- After leaving the room late in the day, the cleaning staff working on another room saw me and asked if I wanted my room cleaned-- Doorman offering and efficiently getting taxis for me, and communicating with the driver where I wanted to go. They asked me to wait in the air-conditioned lobby while they were hailing a taxi-- Acceptable to very good English communication skills. The hotel staff that I interacted with probably had the best English I encountered in SEA-- Staff I passed by that I made eye contact with would ask if you needed anythingExemplary examples were:-- When I entered the elevator and staff were present, they asked what floor I was going to, took my card key and punched in the floor. Iâ€™ve experienced this before with staff on the ground floor/lobby but this happened 3 other times by random staff I met on other floors exiting/entering the elevators with me-- Along the same lines, I saw ground floor elevator staff let 2 muslim men and a woman in a niqab enter and prevented other guests from entering so the 3 can ride up alone. My initial reaction was WTF, Iâ€™m not good enough? But then took it for what it was, staff accommodating an ask from a guest. I was a little perturbed but I canâ€™t blame the staff for this-- Friendly conversation with executive lounge staff including â€¦ * Struck a conversation with executive lounge cook-to-order. He shared his secret on successfully flipping eggs â€¦ lots of oil and a short, focused motion from the elbow forward (have to practice this). I really enjoyed this common courtesy to chat with me * Another conversation with executive lounge staff where I asked about local food and where she liked to eat lunch (e.g. always up to try the really local places). One offered to bring some back for me but instead I offered and she accepted to take me to lunch at restaurant in the back of the hotel that was frequented by staff from several other hotels. It was a memorable experience, thank you Rashvine-- I did some work by the pool and the pool staff surprised me with sliced fruit. I donâ€™t think he normally does this, the fruit was for the flavored water he had at the cabana so I do think it was extra consideration for me. Also proactively offered to move me to a different table and open up the umbrella when the sun was up-- On one occasion, bell hop offering to do something for me that was above and beyond (think it was not normal hotel policy so I wonâ€™t get too specific!)Here are some nits:-- In the executive lounge, focus more on the local flavors. It was more of a western fare with cereal, cooked to order eggs, bread, cheese etc. and limited standard juices. The fruits were the familiar watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew etc. For the local scene, there would typically be one noodle dish, porridge and condiments. IMO, it would definitely be better to have more of a weighted Malaysian (and less western) fare and variety-- Something is not right with the elevator card key system. Its â€œlowâ€, at the bottom of the floor buttons, you have to bend over and it never works with the first insert. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s me, others had issues too (but the staff didnâ€™t seem to have an issue so there was a trick to it). TBH, it was annoying.-- I had a small plate of chocolates in my room as a welcoming gift. There were some small ants crawling over them. Just put a plastic wrap over them, not a big deal but obviously noticeable.My advice to other travelers, take the time to interact and be courteous with the staff. Take the small step to return their smile, start a conversation, and you may be rewarded. To sum up, my rating is not because the physical hotel was outstanding or the hotel amenities were fantastic, I have experienced better. Itâ€™s because of the exceptional staff.To the KL JW Marriott leadership team, you are doing something right here. Iâ€™m not sure how you select the staff or what training you provide but (very importantly) it was a consistent performance from all your staff and your team ""personalized"" my experience.(BTW, give them a raise ... lots of other hotels close by!)"
"Where do I start....Location: Amazing an very central, close to everything, you wont need a cabService: 5 star, staff are all very friendlyrooms are so clean, beds tucked and freshened throughout the dayrestaurants in hotel all great, breakfast was my favorite, lovely chef, checking on your food all the time"
"Stayed in JW Marriott KL from 15th Aug to 20th Aug. The upgraded room given to me was very nice and spacious. This was my 5th to 6th stay at JWM KL and it has always been a pleasant stay. All the staffs were very friendly, polite and professional, the bell boy, the concierge, the housekeepers, the chefs â€¦ all the way to the team from the Executive Lounge. Location is excellent, just opposite Pavilion and walking distance to Lot 10 / Bukit Bintang area. Breakfast spread at the main Shook cafÃ© was good, but morning crowd was usually heavy and staffs tend not to be able to attend to your needs promptly. But that was a small issue. My Special Thanks to the following dedicated staffs:1) My Velu from Executive Lounge for his professionalism in attending to guests at the lounge, remembering faces and names. And also for accommodating the last minute changes in my room reservation. 2) Mt TIka for his attentiveness, making effort to meet me learning of my return to the hotel and ensuring everything was ok w my stay. 3) Mr Surmon, Mr Zakir & Ms Arisa from the Executive Lounge for their friendliness, their attentiveness to my needs during my stay at the lounge and for being prompt with their service. 4) Mr Rahul who is always cheerful mending the egg station during breakfast and the carving station during the evening cocktail at the Executive Lounge. He will always approached guests offering us either eggs or the day's dish, making me feel comfortable as I do not have to be the one asking. And his service is fast. 5) Ms Letchmi from Shook. I first met her when she was mending the pancake section last year, and she was good at the pancakes she made. She was also helpful and did not show any unapproved face when I requested her to add banana on my pancakes. Infact she made a good one for me from the start. And during my recent visit, she was helping the chef at the egg station. She did not make a good omelette though (maybe that's not her forte), but she was helpful in taking some of the egg orders because the queue on that day was very long and as usual did not fail to serve with a smile despite the crowd and the volume of orders. 6) Ms Fiza from ""At Your Service"" who always greets me with a pleasant & friendly voice, understanding my needs and remembering my requests and ensuring it gets executed timely and well. 7) Last but not least, Mr Rasel from Housekeeping. He understands how I want my room to be cleaned and executed it well, without showing any displeasure. Attached, a little creation made by Rasel and it made guest feel appreciated."
"Location is great, just in front of pavilion. 10mins walk to Klcc / twin towers.Rooms are renovated recently, so quite new and modern, and spacious. Service is top notch. Worth staying. Way better than the dated Westin which is next door."
"This was my 3rd stay at JWM KL and I felt at home in my room which was upgraded as my platinum member benefit. Compared to other JWM, every staff in JWM KL is so friendly that I can feel a sense of familiarity.I happened to make a friend, Mr.Akkas, who works as a batler at JWM. He has been trying to make my stay memorable as much as he can and that is one of the reasons why I choose JWM when I come back to this lovely city, Kuala Lumpur.Location is perfect. Guests can reach hundreds of restaurants from local to fancy only less than 10 minutes walking. If you consider to stay at around Bukit Bintang area, JWM could be the best choice for your stressless stay in Kuala Lumpur."
"This hotel experience was really fabulous, location is very near to pavillion mall and located in the heart of the city.. room were very clean and furniture is new.. window glass is sound proof. The breakfast was excellent with a lot of variety.. i recommended this hotel for trip advisor "
"One of the best JW Marriotts in the world and I have been to several. My accommodations (room 2137) were emaculant and very spacious. The staff was well trained, very friendly and always willing to help. The lounge for premium members was well appointed and the food was resturant quality. I absolutely enjoyed the egg omelet station each morning.The consierge also arranged for my round rounfdtrip transportation to and from the airport. No detail is overlooked.AND the shopping and food choices will truly impress your eyes and senses. The LV store is located in the lobby. The hotel location is too ideal. There is so much action, so many lights and fashion to capture your attention .It feels like Time Square or the Vegas strip. I can not wait to come back."
"Always in KL I stay at Westin.1st time trying JW Marriott... a bit disappointed with the lounge. Service need to improve, the lounge is quite small compare to Westin. Hotels staffs is very friendly. Meeting is good compare to Westin. "
"I frequent Kuala Lumpur alot and usually stay in the Bukit Bintang Area. So most stays I'm either at the Westin or the Ritz Carlton. For this trip, I decided to give the Marriot a try, also point to note, this is the JW Marriot (higher up the hierarchy of Marriot Hotels). I had booked 2 rooms and though I requested for an earlier check in, it was subject to availability since they normally check in at 3 p.m. I understood this and hence I finished my meetings and came to check in around 4 p.m. I have been an SPG member and Marriot member for years. My preferences are always kept on the online profile and once again I chose Non - Smoking Room. Unfortunately during the check in, the front desk told long to find a room and finally said there was no room available unless I take the Smoking Room. Well that's quite sad! I understand the hotel group has a Reservation Guaranteed policy but my reservation was clearly not guaranteed unless I take a Smoking Room. After refusing this and hearing repeatedly they have no rooms, I was upset and told them to do something serious. After waiting for some time, the staff came back and said they will arrange a room at the Ritz Carlton which is a short walk from the Marriot. Not that I mind the Ritz, but I wanted to try the Marriot, that's why I took it. Well this was not acceptable and I told them that their reservation was to be guaranteed, and it's not fair that I have to go to another hotel. Eventually after another long wait, they finally found 1 room for me, while my friend had no room. We accepted this and were informed that as soon as the 2nd room was available we would get a call. Well we left the hotel and was out for dinner and drinks. At around 11 plus at night we still did not get a call. On our way back we had to call the hotel to ask for the 2nd room. After checking the finally confirmed that the second room was confirmed. The above might not seem like such a bid deal to some, but considering this is the JW Marriot, I would have expected a much more higher level of service. For me the answers and replies from the staff seemed robotic and the warmth unfortunately is just missing. They seem a bit lost as to where they are working. Rooms are good as expected and the breakfast spread is good too though the layout can be a bit messy and confusing. I am returning again this week, but will stay at the Ritz."

"JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur is at the busiest shopping area in KL. If you are visiting KL for shopping and delicious local food, this hotel is very convenient for you.When I was staying here, this hotel is under renovation. The Executive Lounge and Gym were located at temporary area. To be honest, the temporary area looked very old. It wasnâ€™t even comfortable. However, I would choose to visit this hotel again because of its excellent service.I was in KL for business trip. During my stay, I often visited the Executive Lounge. At there, I met the Executive Lounger manager - Mr. Velu. He is a very nice and friendly person. Whenever you meet with you, you can feel his passion about this job. Therefore, he always provides the excellent service. He can remember not only your name but also your needs. He can also provide some good recommendations if you are seeking for place for dining or shopping. I really appreciated for his services during my stay"
"The positives 1)Rooms are good2)Housekeeping and floor managers are very responsive3)very good location 4)Helpful staff for early check in and late check outThe negatives1)As soon as we landed we were given the wrong key which delayed the process of getting into the room and relaxing after an overnite flight2)Was famished but no-one answered the ph for Room service or the reception. Had to go and personally call for assistance3)The buffet breakfast was a damper and sorry to say one of the worst I have had in a 4star+ anywhere, though it was a huge spread. Didn't in the least enjoy it. To top it off, they had only basic tea or coffee that too not at all good as the only option. This was a surprise for the 1st time in any hotel that I have stayed."
an excellent hotel with all the high luxury and al the staffs are very friendly and helpful. location are good and very convenient to all the shopping center. value for money and the restaurant serve varieties of food
My husband and I just got married two weeks ago at this Marriott location and we had an unforgettable time. The amenities were wonderful. The hotel was so clean and the breakfast was too good. The staff were so wonderful and kind and continuously asked us if there was anything they could do for us and each one of them made sure to go out of their way to congratulate us on our wedding. We had a wonderful experience and wedding. Thank you to everyone who made this such a special experience !!
"Rooms are perfect for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) and comfortable for the 4 of us. The buffet breakfast spread was good. Had a variety of choices, almost everything you would look for in a buffet breakfast."
"The hotel was one of the 2 recommended by the wedding organizers and we got a great deal. The hotel, service, people and facilities are first rate. The hotel is located in the centre of KL only a short walk to the underground or Monorail or a myriad of shops and markets, both food and other goods. "
This hotel is situated in one of the best part of cardio is very clean and has amazing views over the whole of KL I really like it Iâ€™ve been staying there for over 15 years. It is right next to Babey Plaza and across the road from two of the large shopping centres 
"We stayed here on Chinese New year, it was beautiful!! The staff service is five star. The room is spacious and very modern. The swimming pool is our kids favourite, but i would love if there's a bit more of greenery and shades :)"
"There was a bit of confusion during check-in. Initially I was asked to go upstairs to the lounge to check-in as elite member, but there was nobody in the lounge so I had to come back down.Other than little inconvenience stated above, everything else is great. As others have said, hotel location is very strategically located, just across from the upscale Pavillion mall. Hotel is also connected to a mall (Gallery?). Room is clean and nice, bed is comfy. Bathroom is also clean and modern. Staffs were very friendly both during check-in (other than confusion stated above) and in the lounge.Overall, very pleasant stay and I would love to come back."
"We were very pleased with this hotel. Great location, very high luxury. We saw an amazing wedding where the entire wedding party arrived in Porches - very cool like a red carpet arrival. We were in the center of everything and it was very easy to walk around to the different food, shopping and entertainment places. The rooms were very nice, and you could not beat the price for what you got. "
"Amazing hotel, ultra luxurious and modern. Staff are fantastic and the gym is amazing! The hotel is connected to a very high end shopping centre which is cool, and itâ€™s across the road from a very big shopping centre too. Would definitely recommend this hotel!! "
"This is the second review of our week long holiday to Kuala Lumpur. The first three nights were spent at The Ritz Carlton and the final two at JW Marriott. What a great experience. Newly renovated rooms. Great staff. Great facilities. You just canâ€™t fault the place. Breakfast was a bit of a hike, but worth it. The only thing I would have changed was the order in which I stayed. We should have booked JW Marriott first, followed by The Ritz Carlton. We will be back - for sure!"
"Pros- recently refurbished - rooms are beautifully appointed- good sized rooms- very nice bathroom- prime location in Bukit Bintang, right across the street from Pavillion shopping centre which has a wide selection of shopping and food optionsCons- pricey (albeit you do get what you pay for)- check-in was slowI would definitely stay here again"
"This hotel is conveniently located in the busy shopping Bukit Bintang area. There are many good shopping malls around with great food. Pavilion, Lot 10, Sungai Wang and even Time Square are all within walking distance. The famous Jalan Alor is only minutes away by foot. The free city shuttle has a stop right in front of the hotel that brings you to KLCC and Central Market. Always enjoy the Executive Lounge with the team of very attentive staff led by Velu, the Lounge Manager. Velu is one of the reasons that I kept coming back to this hotel. He is very personable and takes good care of all his guests, not only when in the lounge but also other needs with the rooms, etc. Thanks Velu for making my stays so comfortable."
We love this hotel and have been using this hotel often when staying in KUL over the last 10 years. The staff are fantastic and many have been there for over 10 years. The rooms are great and the beds are super comfortable!
I have stayed at several JW Marriotts but this has to be one of the best I have ever stayed at. The staff was wonderful and super friendly. Ms Rita that helped us with all our group stuff was super professional and helpful. The location is perfect with plenty to do right outside. I definitely recommend staying here!
